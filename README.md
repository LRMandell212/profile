My github profile page

Notes:
This page is based on my empty project file/directory structure.

Design Notes:
16:03 12/21/2020 - My initial thought is that this should work somewhat like my own personal linkedin page. Although with a bit more personality.
LinkedIn sections
Header
* Photo, Name, Title, Location
* About
* Featured (Posts, images, project launches, repositories, etc)
* Experience
* Education
* Interests

Design goals:
* works as an HTML only file
* mobile-first, responsive, progressively enhanced
* accessible
